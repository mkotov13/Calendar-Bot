### Calendar Bot

Looking for when the Add/Drop deadline is? Just ask the Calendar Bot!

Finding the needed date in the Academic Calendar can be quite tedious. You either have to browse the school's website or search in a pdf file (in case you consult the calendar so often that you had to download a copy). Either way, it gets annoying.

All you have to do now is ask the friendly Calendar Bot! Its interface is incredibly simple, and it retrieves information in a matter of seconds.
