###Motion AI
For my first bot I was looking for a platform that would ideally help me build a bot with little to no coding involved. After doing a little bit of research and reaching out to the chatbot-building community online, I came across Motion AI.
Advantages
Simple interface
Easy design of conversational flows
Default spelling correction
Straight-forward process of deploying the bot online
Disadvantages
Limited amount of premade conversational blocks
No possibility for automation

Testing of the bot was conducted manually before the release. After getting other users involved, I used conversational logs for debugging and quality assurance.
A few bugs were detected as soon as the first outside user interacted with the bot.
When testing came around, it was decided to update the design in order to retain bot’s main competitive advantage over traditional web surfing - convenience. What is the point of collecting user’s email and asking whether they are a human or a robot, especially if that information is not utilized anywhere down the road?
##UPDATES
#Customization

A couple months after I wrote this Motion AI added the ability to have modules with executable Node.JS code. This update could not be more welcome as it virtually allows creating a chatbot of any level of complexity. It also addresses the issue of the platform’s limitations when working with larger number of outcomes from a given module. Now all of the instances of the modules with the information about certain dates can be replaced with a single block of code that has a switch case statement.
